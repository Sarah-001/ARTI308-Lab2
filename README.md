## Lab 2: Identifying ML Problems, Selecting Open Datasets, and Drawing a Methodology Diagram 

**Dataset Summary**
This project for Lab 2 uses the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset Taken from Kaggle. Moreover, the dataset contains tabular data related to lifestyle habits, and health indicators. In addition,  this dataset includes numerical and categorical features such as age, sleep duration, stress level, physical activity level, BMI category, and occupation.

**Description of machine learning problem**
The goal of this project is to predict whether a person has a sleep disorder based on lifestyle and health features. The target variable is the "Sleep Disorder" column, which contains categorical values (None, Insomnia, and Sleep Apnea).
This problem is a classification problem because the model predicts a categorical outcome not a continuous numerical value.
